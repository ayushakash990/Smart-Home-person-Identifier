# Smart-Home-person-Identifier

 An application that will **Detect a person's identity** ringing the doorbell or standing in front of the door by taking various frames of their faces through cameras installed 
 in front of the door. After searching in the database it will tell the person name(by using **Text to speech** method) if it is matching with the Database, and if it is not         matching it will tell that the person is Unknown.
